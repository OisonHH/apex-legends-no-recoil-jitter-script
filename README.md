# Apex Legends No Recoil Jitter Script

A simple Logitech LUA script to reduce recoil in Apex Legends using jitter-aiming.

# How it Works

When you hold down left-click and **Activation key is ON**, the script rapidly moves the mouse in a jitter pattern. This can help reduce vertical recoil in automatic weapons.

üöÄ Usage
Open Logitech G HUB or LGS.

Create a new profile for Apex Legends.

Paste this script into the scripting section.

Make sure Activation Key is ON when you fire to activate the jitter aim.
